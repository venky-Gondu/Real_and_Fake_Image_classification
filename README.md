# Visual Integrity Checker for Images

## Project Purpose
This project leverages machine learning to classify images as real or fake, using deep learning models and a robust dataset.

## Project Structure

- **src/**: Main source code and entry script.
- **models/**: Pre-trained models and weights.
- **data/**: Training and validation datasets (CSV files).
- **training_scripts/**: Scripts for training/evaluation.
- **tests/**: Test files for validation.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **README.md**: Project overview and instructions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the requirements:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main script:  
   `python src/main.py`

## Usage

- Train, evaluate, and test deepfake detection models.
- Use provided CSVs for training/validation splits.
- Pre-trained models are in the `models/` folder.
